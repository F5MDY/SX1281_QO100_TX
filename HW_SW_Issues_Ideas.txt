JU - comments to initial PCB revision from 24.08.2021:
  - PRG and RST pushbuttons too close to each other. Place them more apart to make the handling with fingers easier.
  - move LD117ADT more to left or right so that we can put there distance pole for OLED display (right hole is OK, left one intersects with LD117ADT)
  - 78L05 is heating up too much when supplied from 12VCD. Perhaps put 1-2 diodes (2A or more rated) in series before, this will also serve as reverse polarity protection.
    Make the ground area around 78L05 free, also if possible make several VIAs to bottom GND to ease the heat dissipation
    
  - add 100pF capacitors from encoder pins to ground; will filter out noise from encoder contacts
  - add 4-th pin to pin header and connect it to +5V. This will make it possible to power the kit e.g. from USB cable
    Note: with max. output power the current drawn is very high and will not work with standard USB port. Solution is to set lower output power.
