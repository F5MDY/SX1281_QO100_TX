JU - comments to initial PCB revision from 24.08.2021:
  
  - move LD117ADT more to left or right so that we can put there distance pole for OLED display (right hole is OK, left one intersects with LD117ADT)
    Note: with max. output power the current drawn is very high and will not work with standard USB port. Solution is to set lower output power.
